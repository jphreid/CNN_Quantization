# Reproducibility challenge 

## Training and inference with integers in deep neural networks. 
CoRR, abs/1802.04680, 2018.

- Top.py trains the models. We tested this model on MNIST, CIFAR and SVHN datasets. 
- Option.py set the quantization model options. 
- Quantize.ipynb includes simple analysis of quantization. 
- PlotMe.ipynb includes all the plots shown in the final report.
